# Progress

## Current Status
The e-commerce application is in active maintenance and enhancement. Core functionality is operational with ongoing improvements focused on security, user experience, and performance optimizations. The UI is being progressively modernized with a consistent coffee-themed design system.

## What Works

- **Payment Integration**: MoMo and VNPay gateways with error handling
- **Order Management**: Order history, order details
- **Admin Dashboard**: Product management, order processing, user management
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Product Customization**: Size options, flavor additions, and extras

## Technical Implementations
