## Technical Constraints

### Performance Considerations
- Response time should be under 500ms for most operations
- Database queries should be optimized for efficiency
- Static assets should be properly cached
- Asynchronous operations for potentially slow tasks
- Minimize DOM manipulations for better client-side performance
- Optimize image uploads and processing for profile avatars

### Security Requirements
- All user data must be encrypted at rest
- Passwords must be securely hashed using Identity best practices
- HTTPS must be enforced for all communications
- Input validation must be performed on all user inputs
- Authentication and authorization must be enforced for protected resources
- Proper null checks to prevent null reference exceptions
- File upload validation to prevent security vulnerabilities

### Stability Requirements
- Defensive programming practices throughout the codebase
- Graceful handling of unexpected conditions and errors
- Comprehensive logging of exceptions and errors
- Fallback strategies for critical functionality
- Mobile-friendly responsive design that works on all devices

### Scalability Needs
- Application should be designed to scale horizontally
- Database design should consider potential growth
- Stateless design where possible to support load balancing
- Component-based UI structure for reusability and maintenance

### Browser Compatibility
- Must support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design for mobile and tablet devices
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers where possible

## Dependencies
The application relies on the following NuGet packages:

- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore (9.0.3)
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UI (9.0.3)
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore (9.0.3)
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design (9.0.3)
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer (9.0.3)

## Frontend Libraries
- jQuery 3.6.0
- Bootstrap 5.3.0
- Bootstrap Icons 1.8.0

## UI Implementation Techniques
- CSS Custom Properties for consistent theming
- Card-based design for product displays and profile sections
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Modal dialogs for quick views
- Hover effects for interactive elements
- Quantity controls with intuitive interface
- CSS animations for UI feedback
- Advanced CSS selectors for styling without additional markup
- Defensive null checking with null-conditional operators for UI elements
- File upload preview with client-side JavaScript
- Responsive service cards that adapt to different screen sizes
- Fade-in animations for alerts and important notifications

## Deployment Strategy
- Docker-based deployment for consistent environments
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
