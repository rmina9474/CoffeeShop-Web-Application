- Session security: Implementing anti-forgery tokens and CSRF protection
- UI simplification: Reducing redundant buttons and improving visual hierarchy
- Payment flow: Improving the checkout process with better validation and error handling
- Error handling: Implementing comprehensive logging and user-friendly error messages
- API communication: Using proper HTTP headers and timeout handling for external services
- Responsive design: Ensuring all pages work well on mobile devices
- Card-based product display: Using consistent card components with hover effects
- Modal dialogs for product customization: Offering a streamlined experience for product options

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring consistent design system implementation across all pages
- Ensuring consistent session state management across the application
- Managing shopping cart synchronization between guest and authenticated users
- Maintaining consistent price formatting in VND currency
- Addressing null reference exceptions in various parts of the application
- Ensuring AJAX requests work consistently across browsers
- Optimizing shopping cart update operations for performance

## Open Questions
- Should we implement a client-side caching mechanism for the shopping cart?
- What performance optimizations can be made for the product catalog?
- How should we handle payment processing security in the checkout flow?
- Should user preferences be stored in session or in user profiles?
- What additional debugging tools should we implement for development?
- How do we handle abandoned shopping carts?
- Should we implement retry mechanisms for failed payment gateway requests?
- Should we continue with the coffee-themed design system or consider other visual themes?
- How can we further optimize the images for faster loading on mobile devices?
