# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in a maintenance and enhancement phase. The core e-commerce functionality is complete, including:
- User registration and authentication
- Product catalog with browsing and search
- Shopping cart functionality
- Checkout process
- Order management
- Admin dashboard

Recent work has focused on UI modernization of the home page to create a more user-friendly experience, particularly for the ordering process. Additionally, bug fixes addressing compilation errors in the UserController and CSS syntax issues in the home page have been implemented.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed UserController inheritance issues by properly inheriting from Controller class
- Resolved CSS syntax errors with @keyframes in the home page
- Fixed type comparison issues in the home page (string vs int comparison)
- Modernized the home page UI with improved layout and visual design
- Added a dedicated "Quick Order" section for faster purchasing
- Implemented enhanced product cards with hover effects and quick actions
- Added direct "Add to Cart" functionality from multiple locations
- Improved quantity selection UI for better user experience
- Added visual feedback with toast notifications for cart actions
- Added animation effects to improve user engagement
- Fixed null reference exceptions in _Layout.cshtml by adding proper null checks for User.Identity
- Added null-conditional operators for ViewContext.RouteData.Values to prevent crashes
- Implemented better error handling for cart count display

- Added new product columns to the database (add_product_columns.sql)
- Added coffee products to the database (add_coffee_products.sql)
- Updated orders table structure (update_orders_table.sql)
- Infrastructure improvements with Docker containerization

## Active Decisions
1. **UI/UX Strategy**: Modernizing the interface for better user experience and increased conversion rates
2. **Error Handling Strategy**: Implementing defensive coding practices with proper null checks throughout the application
3. **Product Catalog Enhancement**: Deciding on optimal product attribute structure for better filtering and search
4. **Database Schema Evolution**: Carefully managing migrations to prevent data loss or disruption
5. **Containerization Strategy**: Finalizing Docker setup for development and production environments

## Current Challenges
- Optimizing product search and filtering performance
- Ensuring proper null checking and error handling throughout the application
- Ensuring smooth database migrations without affecting production data
- Balancing feature enhancements with stability

## Next Steps
1. **Short-term Tasks**:
   - Complete product catalog enhancements
   - Optimize database queries for improved performance
   - Enhance Docker deployment configuration
   - Update README file with latest features and fixes

2. **Medium-term Goals**:
   - Apply consistent UI modernization to other sections of the application
   - Implement advanced search functionality
   - Add product recommendation system
   - Enhance reporting and analytics capabilities

3. **Long-term Vision**:
   - Explore microservices architecture for specific components
   - Implement internationalization for global market
   - Develop mobile companion application

## Open Questions
- Should we implement a more comprehensive error handling strategy across the application?
- What metrics should be prioritized for the analytics dashboard?
- Should we consider a headless CMS approach for content management?
- Is the current database schema optimal for future growth?
- How can we further optimize the ordering process for repeat customers?
