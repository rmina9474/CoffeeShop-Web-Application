## Open Questions
- Which other pages should be prioritized next for UI modernization?
- Should we implement a more comprehensive error handling strategy across the application?
- What metrics should be prioritized for the analytics dashboard?
- Should we consider a headless CMS approach for content management?
- Is the current database schema optimal for future growth?
- How can we further optimize the ordering process for repeat customers?
- How can we ensure CSS consistency across different browsers and screen sizes?
