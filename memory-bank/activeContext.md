# Active Context

## Current Implementation Focus

The project is now focused on optimizing and enhancing the Docker containerization implementation that was recently completed. The application can now be run in a consistent environment across different machines using Docker containers, with both the web application and SQL Server database properly configured.

## Recently Completed

### Docker Containerization

The Docker implementation has been successfully completed with the following components:

1. **Dockerfile**
   - Multi-stage build for efficient image creation
   - Proper configuration for .NET 9.0 application
   - User permissions and security settings
   - Health check configuration

2. **Docker Compose Setup**
   - Web application container configuration
   - SQL Server container with proper settings
   - Network configuration for secure communication
   - Volume mapping for database persistence
   - Environment variable configuration

3. **Startup Script**
   - Created `docker-run.sh` for easy deployment
   - Implemented Docker status checking
   - Added container cleanup functionality
   - Included detailed output for user guidance
   - Added `--remove-orphans` flag to clean up orphaned containers

4. **Database Configuration**
   - Implemented environment-based database provider switching
   - Configured SQL Server connection for containerized environment
   - Ensured proper database initialization and migration
   - Set up persistent volume for data storage

5. **Health Monitoring**
   - Added health checks for both application and database
   - Configured proper restart policies
   - Implemented logging and status reporting

6. **Documentation**
   - Updated README with Docker deployment instructions

   - Documented common Docker commands and troubleshooting steps

## Active Design Decisions

1. **Database Provider Strategy**
   - Using SQLite for local development for simplicity
   - Automatically switching to SQL Server in Docker environment
   - Database provider selection based on environment variable

2. **Container Communication**
   - Web application container depends on SQL Server container
   - Using Docker network for secure inter-container communication
   - Using environment variables for configuration

3. **Data Persistence**
   - SQL Server data persisted using Docker volumes
   - Images and uploaded files mapped to host for persistence
   - Ensuring proper permissions and ownership for file access

4. **Health Monitoring**
   - Active monitoring of container health
   - Regular health checks with appropriate intervals
   - Restart policies for automatic recovery

5. **Docker Cleanup Strategy**
   - Automatic cleanup of orphaned containers with `--remove-orphans` flag
   - Consistent container naming for easier management
   - Proper shutdown procedures to prevent resource leakage

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Optimize Docker Configuration**
